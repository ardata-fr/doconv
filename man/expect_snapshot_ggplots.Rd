\arguments{
\item{x}{a ggplot2 object or a list of ggplot2 objects.}

\item{name}{a unique string used as the snapshot file name
(\verb{<name>.png}). Must be unique across the test file.}

\item{width, height}{image dimensions (default 9 x 7 inches).}

\item{units}{units for width/height, default "in".}

\item{res}{resolution in DPI, default 200.}

\item{ncol}{number of images per row in the composite when \code{x}
is a list (default \code{NULL}, one image per row).}

\item{tolerance}{ratio of different pixels allowed, default 0.001.}
}
\value{
The result of \code{\link[=expect_snapshot_doc]{expect_snapshot_doc()}}.

\description{
Renders ggplot2 objects to PNG with ragg and compares
against a reference snapshot using \code{\link[=expect_snapshot_doc]{expect_snapshot_doc()}}.

When \code{x} is a list of ggplot2 objects, individual renderings are
assembled into a single composite image via \code{images_to_miniature()}.
By default each plot occupies its own row; use \code{ncol} to arrange
several plots per row. The snapshot is always a single file
named \verb{<name>.png}, stored in testthat's \verb{_snaps} directory.

If a plot fails to render, its slot is replaced by a blank white
rectangle of the same dimensions, making the failure visible in
the diff.

On the first run the reference snapshot is created and the
test is reported as a new snapshot. Subsequent runs compare
the current rendering against the stored reference.
