Description: Functions to convert documents to 'PDF' or 'PNG'. 
 The tool offers a set of functions for converting 'Microsoft Word' or 
 'Microsoft PowerPoint' documents to 'PDF' format and also for converting 
 them to images in the form of thumbnails. In order to work, 'LibreOffice' 
 must be installed on the machine and possibly 'python' and 'Microsoft Word'.
 If the latter is available, it can be used to produce PDF documents identical 
 to the originals, otherwise, 'LibreOffice' is used.
