Description: Provides the ability to generate images from documents
 of different types. Three main features are provided: generating
 document thumbnails, performing visual tests of documents, and
 updating fields and tables of contents of a 'Microsoft Word' or
 'RTF' document. 'Microsoft Word' and/or 'LibreOffice' must be
 installed on the machine. If 'Microsoft Word' is available, it
 can produce PDF documents or images identical to the originals;
 otherwise 'LibreOffice' is used and the rendering may sometimes
 differ from the original documents.
